# File Organizer

This Python script organizes files from a source folder into destination folders based on their file extensions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

	git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer.git
	cd file-organizer



2. Modify the script (file_organizer.py) with your source and destination folder paths:

	source_folder = "path/to/source/folder"
	destination_folder = "path/to/destination/folder"



3. Run the script:

	python3 file_organizer.py
